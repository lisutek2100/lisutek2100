ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stavrosfilippidis a cloud and security engineer that worked extensively in the 
startup scene. I'm a big fan of open source technology and what it provides to the tech world. 
My specialties are building and securing cloud infrastructure and working with innovative teams on 
meaningful technology.

### A bit of OSS 

While working at previous companies, I noticed a recurring need for 
adjacent infrastructure in the areas of monitoring, observability and bastion hosts. 
The following modules utilize modern open source technology to provide a 
starting base for platform engineers who require these common use cases.

  - [Observability Hub](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_observability_hub) an observability facility that can be used to oversee your systems.
  - [Metrics Hub](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_metrics_collector) a monitoring facility to scrap metrics from endpoints and expose them for further usage. 
  - [Bastion Host](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_wireguard_vpn) a VPN leveraging Wireguard to lower your attack surface.
  - [Terraform Remote Backend](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_s3_remote_terraform_backend) creates the infrastructure needed to operate Terraform with a remote state.


The modules are built using Terraform and can be easily customized or extended for different contexts in AWS environments.
If you encounter any issues or bugs, please don't hesitate to contact me.
