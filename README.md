### Check out some OSS contributions I've done 

While working at previous companies, I noticed a recurring need for 
adjacent infrastructure in the areas of monitoring, observability, bastion hosts. 
The following modules utilize modern open source technology 
and provide a starting point for platform engineers who require these common use cases.

  - [Observability Hub](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_observability_hub) a observability cluster that can be used to oversee your systems.
  - [Metrics Hub](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_metrics_collector) a cluster leveraging Prometheus to scrap metrics from endpoints and expose them for further usage. 
  - [Bastion Host](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_wireguard_vpn) a VPN leveraging Wireguard to lower your attack surface.
  - [Terraform Remote Backend](https://github.com/stavrosfilippidis/tf_aws_s3_remote_terraform_backend) creates the infrastructure needed to operate Terraform with a remote state.


The modules are built using Terraform and can be easily customized or extended for different contexts in AWS environments.
If you encounter any issues or bugs, please don't hesitate to contact me.
